- The objective is to provide meaningful insights that can help lenders and borrowers make informed decisions.

# Key Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data.
- Convert categorical variables into numerical form for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand borrower demographics, loan terms, and payment status.
- Identify trends in interest rates, loan amounts, and credit scores.
- Examine correlations between loan defaults and borrower attributes.

# Visualization & Insights
- Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations.
- Identify trends affecting loan approval and risk factors for defaults.
- Build a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict loan default risk.
- Evaluate model accuracy using performance metrics.
# Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of key factors influencing loan approval and interest rates.
- Insights into borrower behavior and the likelihood of loan default.
- Recommendations to improve lending strategies and risk management
